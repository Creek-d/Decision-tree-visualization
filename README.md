# Penguin Decision Tree Classifier

This repository contains a decision tree classifier used to predict penguin species (Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo) based on physical measurements such as flipper length, culmen length/depth, and body mass.
The project focuses on model interpretability by visualizing the decision tree and explaining how feature-based threshold splits lead to final class predictions. Gini impurity is used as the splitting criterion to measure node purity.
# Features
- Decision Tree classification
- Gini impurity–based splits
- Clear tree visualization
- Interpretable machine learning model
# Dataset
Palmer Penguins dataset
# Goal
To demonstrate how decision trees make classification decisions using simple, human-readable rules.
